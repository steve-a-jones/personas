# Projects

Use this index to route to the right project type.

| Project Type | Purpose | Start Here | Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Specs | Technical specs, indexes, and shared scaffolding. | `src/specs/INDEX.md` or `src/specs/system/README.md` | `src/specs/` |

## Layout Convention
Each project type owns a top-level folder under `src/` and ships a `README.md` at its root for guidance.
