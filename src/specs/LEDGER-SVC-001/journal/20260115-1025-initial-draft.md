## Summary
- Initial spec draft for the Ledger Service (Python/Postgres/AWS) created with core domain model, API, and operational requirements.

## Changes Made
- Drafted spec.md with scope, invariants, API surfaces, storage design, and rollout plan.
- Created progress.md with resume snapshot, risks, assumptions, and decision log.

## Decisions
- Append-only ledger with enforced double-entry invariants at write time.
- Use outbox pattern for reliable downstream event emission.
- Require idempotency keys for all posting requests.

## Open Questions
- [ ] Expected peak TPS and data volume for sizing and partitioning.
- [ ] Required retention period beyond 7 years for compliance.
- [ ] Single-currency per transaction is assumed; is multi-currency needed in v1?
- [ ] Which upstream systems will dual-write during migration?

## Next Actions
- Request persona reviews (PM, Product, UX, Engineering, Test, Spec Director).
- Validate throughput, retention, and migration assumptions with stakeholders.
