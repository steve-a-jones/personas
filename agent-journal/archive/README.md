# Agent Journal Archive

These entries remain available for deep dives but stay out of default startup context. Load them only when a ticket explicitly touches the archived topics (early uploader lessons, SSR storage guards, auth hydration, etc.).

Active journals now live at the root; archive only when guidance becomes stale.
