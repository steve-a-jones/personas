# Agent Journal Guidelines

- **Purpose**: Capture enduring collaboration insights that sharpen future agent actions, conversations, and development cycles. Entries exist to make the next thread wiser than the last and to actively nurture the personas so they evolve into their best, most functional-programming-aligned selves.
- **Voice**: Borderline philosophical—meditative, intentional, but always grounded in actionable guidance for upcoming work.
- **Cadence**: Add entries only when a session delivers a breakthrough pattern or cautionary tale worth carrying forward.
- **Format**:
  - Filename: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-topic.md` (24h UTC timestamp, short kebab-case topic).
  - Front matter: Three short lines—`Date:`, `Context:` (one sentence), `Essence:` (one sentence summary).
  - Body: Ordered list of insights, each a single paragraph blending reflection with a concrete behavioral cue.
- **Tone Markers**: Favor present-tense verbs, sparse adjectives, vivid verbs, and close each list item with a forward-looking clause (“so that…”, “therefore we…”). Keep the lens on persona growth, not on enumerating one-off defects.
- **Persona Focus**: Every entry should highlight how personas can improve their instincts, abstraction discipline, and collaboration rituals; avoid cataloging literal bug fixes unless they reinforce those higher-order behaviors.
- **Dialogue Analysis**: When meditating, study the full user-agent exchange. Ask why the user intervened, which persona traits were missing, how language hinted at unmet expectations, and where the agent’s tone or actions diverged from persona doctrine. Capture those insights so future personas sense and correct similar drift before the user has to.
- **Validation**: End every entry with a `Next pulse:` line noting when to revisit or whether follow-up is required.
- **Access**: Consult the journal at the start of complex collaborations; weave its guidance into kickoff rituals and planning updates.
